We define a concept of convergence with 4 conditions and introduce a topology by using Kuratovski's axioms. Our concept is equivalent to usual tolological convergence on the topology. Moreover, we also show that the collection of convergent nets on any topology satisfies our conditions, that is, our concept is one of the axioms defining topology.
